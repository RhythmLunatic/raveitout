# Rave It Out: Weaboo Edition
The unofficial mod to RIO S2 where the music is replaced with Voltexes, the pictures are supplied yourself, and there are probably less bugs because I ripped out all the RIO centric features.

Also the heart system is removed.

## Usage
Works on 5.0.12+ only. Auto Velocity will not work if you do not compile the [latest 5.1-new branch](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/tree/5_1-new) of StepMania or [our fork](https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/stepmania/tree/starworlds).

Configure the groups for Easy and Special mode in 01 SYSTEM_PARAMETERS.lua.

Supports Dance and Pump mode, although the graphics will still be for pump. (May support other modes too, but you'll probably get some bugs)

## Configuration

Check the operator menu. Edit 01 SYSTEM_PARAMETERS.lua.

## Adding new songs

Check Song Structure Documentation.txt.
